# interactiveLoginScreen
<h1> Screen Login </h1>
This project is a demonstration of
a simple login and registration screen.

When the user clicks on "Register", a new page appears.
Then, when the user clicks "Login" it returns to the previous page.
These interactions were made with the "onClick" event.
